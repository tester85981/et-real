        "If you keep chopping the tree in the same spot, Ryan, it's going to fall. Consistency buys the yacht.",
        "Ryan, you can't get to the next level if you don't invest in yourself. Be the man your daughters think you are.",
        "Somebody is waiting on your greatness, Ryan. Your daughters, your wife, your Dad. Don't let them down.",
